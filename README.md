# Panel Selection Methods
Despite the increased panel sizes that multiplex imaging enables, they are still limited by practical capacities at high rounds of staining that reduce image quality. For this reason it is necessary to choose panels intelligently such that the most biological information is obtained. Designing such panels, however, is difficult becuase it isn't always possible to know which markers will be informative and which will be reduceable ahead of time. Here I present a series of methods that were tested for quantitatively selecting a reduced panel which can then be used to reconstruct the full panel, such that the maximum amount of information is retained.
